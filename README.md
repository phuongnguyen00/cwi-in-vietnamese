# Complex Word Identification in Vietnamese using Support Vector Machines

Text Simplification has been an extensively researched problem in English, but has not been investigated in Vietnamese. We focus on the Vietnamese-specific Complex Word Identification task, the first step in the Lexical Simplification approach as defined by Shardlow. Our experiments across three datasets constructed for other Natural Language Processing tasks in Vietnamese show that frequency is a strong signal in determining whether a word is complex, with a mean accuracy of of 86.87%. From the consistency across the datasets, we find that 10% of most frequent words in any corpus can be labelled as simple, and the rest as complex, although there may be more variability for smaller corpora.
